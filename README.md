## 💡 Project Highlights

- ✅ **Data Import and Preprocessing**: Load engine data, handle missing values, normalize features.
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Distribution plots, box plots, and correlation insights.
- 🧠 **Anomaly Detection Models**:
  - **Isolation Forest**: Tree-based model that isolates anomalies quickly.
  - **One-Class SVM**: Boundary-based model to detect outliers.
- 🔍 **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA**: Visualize high-dimensional data in 2D.
- 📈 **Visualization**: Histograms, box plots, PCA projections, and decision boundaries.
