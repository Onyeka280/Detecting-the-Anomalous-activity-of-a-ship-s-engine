# Conclusion

✅ Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM each detected a set of anomalies  
✅ PCA helped visualize high-dimensional data in two dimensions  
✅ Further improvements could include:
- Fine-tuning model hyperparameters
- Using additional anomaly detection techniques
- Investigating mismatched predictions between models
